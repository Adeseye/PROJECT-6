## WEB SOLUTION WITH WORDPRESS

In this project I will be setting up a storage infrastructure on two Linux servers, implement a basic web solution using WordPress and MySQL as its backend database Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).

This project is divided into two stages

First stage :- Configure storage subsystem for Web and Database servers based on Linux OS. This involves working with disks, partitions and volumes in Linux.

Second stage :- Install WordPress and connect it to a remote MySQL database server.

Now with the first stage I will create two Linux servers, one for Web server and the other for Database server
